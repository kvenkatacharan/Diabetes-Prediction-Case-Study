# Diabetes-Prediction-Case-Study
###**Problem Definition**

A healthcare company wants to check if the patient has diabetes or not based on some diagnostic measurements. 

You, as a data scientist, are given the task to build a Machine Learning model that is capable of predicting if a patient has diabetes.


###**Dataset Description**

> **DATASET:** *Pima Indians Diabetes.csv*


The dataset was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (a subgroup of Native Americans) and are females of ages 21 and above.


The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**NOTE:** You can use this dataset to train your machine learning model to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.


###**Objective**

>* **Classify:** We want to predict if a patient is diabetic or not.
>* **Collecting the data**
>* **Analyzing and Preparing the data:** We may need to convert the categorical values to numerical values. If the dataset contains null values, we will have to fill those values or remove those samples/features, depending upon the number of null values. We will need to fix the outlier values. Scaling of the data has to be done if needed.
>* **Visualizing the data:** Proper plots and graphs will be used for visualization.
>* **Splitting the dataset for evaluation:** Since we want to know how good our model is, we will split the main dataset into training and testing datasets. The test data will be used later for evaluating.
>* **Training the model:** We will create the model by training the algorithm on the training dataset(which contains the actual labels).
>* **Testing the model:**  We will test the model on the test dataset to check how good our model works when it sees a new sample.
>* **Choosing the correct model:** We will use different machine learning algorithms to check which one works well for this problem.
>* **Model Performance:** We will calculate our model's performance, by comparing our predicted values with actual values.
