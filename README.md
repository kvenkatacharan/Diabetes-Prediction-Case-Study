# Diabetes-Prediction-Case-Study
###**Problem Definition**

A healthcare company wants to check if the patient has diabetes or not based on some diagnostic measurements. 

You, as a data scientist, are given the task to build a Machine Learning model that is capable of predicting if a patient has diabetes.


###**Dataset Description**

> **DATASET:** *Pima Indians Diabetes.csv*


The dataset was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (a subgroup of Native Americans) and are females of ages 21 and above.


The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**NOTE:** You can use this dataset to train your machine learning model to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.
